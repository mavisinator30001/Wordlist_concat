# WordCon
A work in progress python program with the purpose of easily expanding wordlists.


# How Do I Run It?
Download the concat.py file and simply run it through the linux terminal in the directory you desire and follow the instructions

# Tips
The input *must* be a text file, and the name of the text file must end in '.txt' or the program will return an error


# Roadmap
Add option to add an entire input file rather than only one key phrase to append to the original word list

... More plans will be formulated in the future, should anyone be interested and support my work
